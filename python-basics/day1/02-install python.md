Installing Python on Windows
Step 1: Download Python
Go to the official Python download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Click on the "Download Python" button.
Select the latest version of Python (e.g., Python 3.9.5) and click on the "Download" button.
Choose the "Windows" option and select the "Executable Installer" (e.g., python-3.9.5-amd64.exe).

Step 2: Run the Installer
Run the downloaded installer (e.g., python-3.9.5-amd64.exe) by double-clicking on it.
Follow the installation wizard's instructions:
Select the installation location (e.g., C:\Python39).
Choose whether to install Python for all users or just the current user.
Select the components to install (e.g., Python, pip, IDLE, etc.).
Choose whether to add Python to the PATH environment variable (recommended).


Step 3: Verify the Installation
Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.
Type python --version and press Enter.
You should see the version of Python you just installed (e.g., Python 3.9.5).

Step 4: Install a Python IDE (Optional)
A Python IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is not required, but it can make coding and debugging easier.
Popular Python IDEs for Windows include:
PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Spyder: https://www.spyder-ide.org/download/

Step 5: Install pip Packages (Optional)
pip is the package installer for Python.
You can install packages using pip by running pip install <package_name> in the Command Prompt or PowerShell.
For example, to install the NumPy package, run pip install numpy.
Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, check the Python installation log files for errors.
If you're having trouble running Python, ensure that the Python executable is in your system's PATH environment variable.
