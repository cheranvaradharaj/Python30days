1.1 Introduction to  Python 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it an ideal language for beginners and experts alike

Features of Python
1. Easy to Learn: Python has a simple syntax and is relatively easy to learn, even for those without prior programming experience.
2. High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language, meaning it abstracts away many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their code rather than memory management.
3. Interpreted Language: Python code is interpreted rather than compiled, making it easy to write and test code quickly.
4. Object-Oriented: Python is an object-oriented language, which organizes code into objects that contain data and functions that operate on that data.
5. Large Standard Library: Python has an extensive and comprehensive standard library that includes modules for various tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and data structures.
6. Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variable types before using them.
7. Cross-Platform: Python can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
8. Extensive Community: Python has a large and active community, with numerous libraries, frameworks, and tools available for various tasks.



Data Science and Machine Learning: Python is widely used in data science and machine learning for tasks such as data analysis, visualization, and model training
